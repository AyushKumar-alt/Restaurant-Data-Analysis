## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project contained **9,551 rows and 21 columns**, with detailed information about restaurants across various cities. Key features included:
- **Restaurant ID, Name, and Location** (Country Code, City, Latitude, Longitude)
- **Cuisines** served
- **Pricing and Ratings** (Average Cost for Two, Price Range, Aggregate Rating, Votes)
- **Service Features** (Table Booking, Online Delivery)

## Project Structure
The internship was divided into three levels, each focusing on specific data science tasks:

### **Level 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- **Tasks:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and converting categorical variables.
- **Tools Used:** Pandas, NumPy.
- **Key Outcomes:** Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

### **Level 2: Descriptive and Geospatial Analysis**
- **Tasks:** Statistical analysis, visualization of top cuisines and cities, geospatial mapping of restaurant density.
- **Tools Used:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas.
- **Key Insights:**  
  - Higher price ranges correlated with better ratings.  
  - Online delivery was more prevalent in mid-tier restaurants.  
  - Urban cities had higher restaurant density and competition.

### **Level 3: Predictive Modeling (Partial Completion)**
- **Tasks:** Feature selection, model building (Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Means Clustering).
- **Tools Used:** Scikit-learn.
- **Key Results:**  
  - **Linear Regression:** R-squared of 0.82 for predicting average cost.  
  - **Random Forest:** Accuracy of 0.89 for classifying online delivery.  
  - **Clustering:** Silhouette Score of 0.72 for geographic clusters.
